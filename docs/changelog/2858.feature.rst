Disallow command line environments which are not explicitly specified in the config file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, any environment would be implicilty created even if no such environment
was specified in the configuration file.

For example, given this config:

.. code-block:: ini
    [testenv:unit]
    deps = pytest
    commands = pytest

Running `tox -e unit` would run our tests but running ``tox -e unt`` or ``tox -e unti``
would ultimately succeed without running any tests.

A special exception is made for environments starting in `py*`. In the above example
running `tox -e py310` would still function as intended.
